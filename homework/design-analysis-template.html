   <h1>Design - Analysis Assessment</h1>
   <h2><!-- Add the example site name as a URL here (e.g. byui.edu) --></h2>
   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Proximity &mdash;

   <p>
    The image has close promitxy with keeping the colors very similar.

   <h3>Alignment &mdash;

   <p>
      This site does good alignment by having like items signed together and by putting the headings for new sections out of alignment so that you know when you have changed sections.
   </p>

   <h3>Repetition &mdash;

   <p>
      In this screenshot, we have four square shapes which is a sign a repetition. Meanwhile, we have different style of shoes and rate which give the variation and consistency in the whole page. In addition, we have repetition in space and color throughout this page.
   </p>

   <h3>Contrast &mdash;

   <img src="/homework/images/Contrast.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
   <p>
      The color styles that are shown vary. We have a White shoe and a multi color show, and a stretched shoe and finally we have a suede shoe. 
   </p>

   <h3>Typography &mdash;
    Jared Russel
   </h3>
   <img src="/homework/images/typography.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
   <p>
         This shows good use of topography by not using too many different font styles. At most on the site there are four different styles used and are most likely the same family of font. The different styles are used consistently (i.e. bold, large and black is used for denoting a new section).
